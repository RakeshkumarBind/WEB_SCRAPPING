<p>This is the scrapping of the fifa groups using pandas library.
In this to export data *pickle* was used but it was not able to open with my local app why?
Because , The thing is, when you use pickle to export it, it converts into a file that can be read again with Python and pickle. For more info, check out the pickle   library</p>
